      <p>Tripping hazards, snakes, ants, etc. Some steep terrain</p>

      <p><strong>Seasonal Influences</strong></p>
      <p>Good safe year-round cutting. Solid track. Long Ridge plantation is saved for 
	  extreme weather conditions cutting when too dangerous to go to any other locations. 
	  It can also be used when the team is running short of time or short-staffed. Keeping 
	  staff may need to access Long Ridge if needing extra special gum for unwell koalas.</p>

      <p><strong>Cutting techniques</strong></p>
      <p>In all sections, the pollarded trees are to be repolladed when the branches 
	  are big enough, new trees that have grown to approx. 20cm diameter can be pollarded.
	  Please be sure to pollard branches flush to the stump. 1 or 2 gum cutting staff.</p>

      <p><strong>Cutting techniques</strong></p>
      <p>Please pile all offcuts in neat piles on track edge. If too large try and pile in 
	  the plantation and then please let the gum coordinator know that there is a clean up 
	  with the plantation trees.</p>

      <p><strong>Annual Maintenance </strong></p>
      <p>February – Blackberry spraying (need to check with Bess) April through to November- 
	  hand weeding, drill and fill of olives May through to November – burning of the wood 
	  and debris piles October/November – slashing of whole site, whipper snipping amongst 
	  trees where slasher cannot access.</p><br>
