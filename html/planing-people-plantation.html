	<h3>Training and Time Management</h3>
	<h4>Staff training and safety</h4>
	
<p>Please ensure gloves, eye and ear protection and helmets are worn when needed.<br>

Working in all weather conditions, be mindful of the extremities, please apply sunscreen, keep fluids
 and nutrition up.<br>
 
Please do not take any undue risks on dropping too large trees or on slippery and steep tracks.<br>

If unsure  please ask your supervisor and do a Take 5 risk assessment first.<br>
If you can alter things to make the job safer do so, but if you cannot please do not do the job.<br>
Your health and safety is the most important thing.<br>
Working on the gum cutting team it is advisable that you pack a lunch and snacks as often you will not
 make it back to the park in time for lunch.  Plan your breaks and if need be, have breaks out on the
 field.<br>
 
Please avoid working in extreme weather conditions, if need be, change your cutting plans to avoid 
storms, extremely wet unsafe conditions and working in extreme heat.  In Summer starting as early to
 cut as early as possible to cut the gum before the heat of the day sets in helps to avoid working in 
 the heat.
</p><br><br>

<h4>Training Certificates required</h4>	

<p>Driving a 4WD - need to hold a 4WD certificate.<br>
Operating a chainsaw - need to have completed a chainsaw course.<br>
( please note chainsaws are only to be operated when working in pairs, never solo). <br>
Dropping large trees - completion of felling trees certificate. <br>
Cross cutting - completion of a cross cutting course. <br>
Operating a chipper - completion of chipping course. <br>
( operation of chipper is in pairs) <br>
Use of chemicals - a completion of the use of chemical course.<br>
Manual Handling. <br>
GRN Radio training (please be aware of the orange safety button on your GRN radio) <br>
If using a bowsaw, gloves must worn (no exceptions) <br>
</p><br><br>

<h4>Fire response plan for Gum cutters</h4>	


<p>Located in Gum 1 is a Gum Cutterâ€™s Bushfires Preparedness and Safety Guide.  <br>
This guide outlines the safest areas to travel to in an event of a fire whilst out cutting at a site.<br>
Please ensure that you are familiar with this manual and the fire safety areas located around the gum
 cutting areas.</p><br><br>
 


<h4>Working on days of Extreme Heat and Fire danger</h4>	

<p>If gum cutting must be carried out on days of extreme fire danger a Bushfire Survival plan form must 
be filled out the day prior and approved by Manager prior to work being undertaken.(Add form here)<br>
All efforts will be made to avoid cutting on extreme days but from time to time it is unavoidable. In 
these cases, the gum cutting team will only be sent to Long Ridge to cut in efforts to keep close to 
park and reduce risk.<br>
On days of extreme heat, the gum cutting team can start early in the morning to avoid cutting the gum 
in the heat of the day.  A gum cutting phone is available from the Admin. Area to take with you as 
another point of contact if you carry a personal mobile phone that is not Telstra. <p>


<h4>Following the weekly gum cutting plan</h4>

<p>Each week you will receive a weekly gum cutting plan via email from  the Senior Koala Keeper outlining 
the amounts of gum required to be cut and the variance of species required along with a guide to the 
locations that this gum can be harvested from.<br>
This plan can change due to extreme weather conditions or gum wind blows etc.<br>
However please ensure this plan is followed and if you need to change it please liaise with Senior Koala
 Keeper.</p> <br><br> 

<h4>Time management/Organisation</h4>

<p>On cutting days you will be generally rostered on with a second cutter.<br> 
Please have tools, equipment fuelled and gum car ready the night before so that you leave for gum cutting
 promptly after your start time in the morning.  Study the weekly plan to know where you are going to cut
 the day before.  If landholders need to be notified that you are heading to their property, please do 
 this communication the day before.</p>


<h4>Changing Plans</h4>
<p>Even though we do our best to have solid gum plans for the week, these plans are subject to change 
through unavoidable circumstances e.g., staffing shortages, extreme weather, fussy koalas etc.</p>

	
	<img src="../images/koala-upsidedown.jpg" alt="" class="images">
		<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Always be prepared with a backup plan for the days 
		when plans get flipped upside down ðŸ˜Š </figcaption>
		<br><br>

<p>If this is the case Long Ridge is always our back up plan for a quick relatively easy cut.  
However, if unsure liaise with the Senior Koala Keeper for ideas of how to work around a sudden change 
in circumstance.  It is always good to be flexible and pliable within your day if need be.</p>


<h4>Problems and Issues</h4>

<p>During the course of your working day, if you have any problems or issues arise, 
please nip it in the bud and  speak to your Manager straight away.<br> 

Please always be aware of your equipment and always keep it is a safe working condition.
  Please see your Manager if you require equipment supplies or vehicle maintenance.
</p>


<h4>Safe Work Procedures Manual</h4>

<p>Please familiarise yourself with the Safe Work Procedures Manual located in the Animal Management
 Office.  Please pay particular attention to Koala Gum cutting, Using a Bowsaw, Sun protection, Working
 in extreme Climatic Conditions, Safe Driving Procedures, Days of Heightened Fire Danger Procedure. 
 Any queries please ask.</p><br>
 
 <h3>Networking/ Working with Landholders</h3>

<p>Over the years Cleland has been extremely fortunate to connect with many landholders throughout the
 region to access many different gum plantations for the harvest of koala fodder. Keeping up a good
 relationship with these landholders is vital the feeding program.</p>


	<img src="../images/gumtruck.jpg" alt="" class="images">
		<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Keeping up great relationships with the
		Cleland Gum supporters.</figcaption>
		<br><br>

<p>Each year just before Christmas Cleland provides complimentary park passes and a letter of appreciation
 to Gum supporting Landholders.  This year 2021 will be the first year a Gum Supporters Appreciation Day
 has been organised, inviting supporters to the park for a BBQ, tour, and Koala experience to help connect
 them to what Cleland is endeavouring to achieve with the Koala Program.
</p>
<p>We can also keep up good relationships by following each individual Landholders rules and expectations
 whist on their land (please read the gum location guide)</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <h3>Larger Projects to think about - Funding and Plans needed</h3>
 
 <h4>Tidy up and development Kuipto Plantation</h4>


<p>The potential for a second Volunteer group during the cooler months would help develop the Kuipto 
Plantation.  The Volunteers to be able to use heavy bladed whipper snippers and chainsaw would be 
of great benefit.<br>
Cleland has had access to cutting at the Kuipto Forestry Headquarters plantation for over 20 years.  <br>
There is still much work to do.  The forest rangers are very happy to work with us on the continual development 
of this area, sometimes they have access to Correctional Services that have helped over the years.<br>
Remove all red gum saplings coming up in between the Manna Gum Rows.<br>
Remove all large wood that is on the ground from previous cuts.<br>
Continue to pollard the large Manna gum trees for feed harvest opening the plantation to more light.</p>



<h4>Tidy Up and development of Stone Hut</h4>

<p>Stone Hut is a very large area to maintain.  Working with Forestry and training groups the aim is to 
tidy up all the big wood and gradually pollard the koala feed trees into plantation style trees.</p>


<h4>Tidy up and redevelopment of Nursery Loop</h4>


<p>Nursery loop which is in Cleland Conservation Park has been left without any real management for well 
over 20 years.  It has the potential to be a very convenient and productive and plantation.  Currently it
 is an area that has many weeds as well as non-indigenous species of gum have been planted in this area, 
 these non-indigenous trees are now spilling into the Conservation Park. <br>
To clean out all weeds and non-indigenous trees species in this area and follow on with a replanting of
 local indigenous species would be highly beneficial to the Koala Feeding Program.
</p>


<h4>Developing a plantation at Deep Creek Conservation Park</h4>

<p>James our previous Gum Plantation Coordinator did some work on developing a Stringybark Plantation 
at Deep Creek.  Cleland is running low on quality accessible Stringybark E.oblique which is one of 
the koalas favourites at certain times of the year.<br>
Stringybark grows well at this location and there is available land for this project.<br>
We will need funding to get this project off the ground, however the long term benefits will be well
 worth it.
</p>


<h4>Seed collection and propagation</h4>
<p>Collecting Eucalyptus seeds from trees that the Koalas really enjoy is a good way of growing trees that
 the koalas enjoy and getting seed from trees in local areas.<br>
When cutting large mature trees down look for seed pods on the branches.  Placed these pods in a paper
 bag and keep some where warm and leave for a month or so.<br>
When warm and dry the seed pods crack open and the tiny little seed drops out onto the bottom of the
 paper bag.  These little seeds can then be collected into a container labelled and stored ready for
 September when propagation can be started.
