        <li><strong>Plantation History</strong> New gum relationship late 2021
Plantation has been grown as a woodlot for past 30 years.  Had bushfire go through in 2020. 
 We can cut the plantation edges to keep powerlines clear.  With the view to further prune the
 plantation trees as they grown and recover, with the consultation of the landholders.<br>
The land is owned by Julie Turner and Neil Heiss and is leased by Chris Williams who runs the
 Alpaca Farm next door.
