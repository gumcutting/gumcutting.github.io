        <li><strong>Plantation History</strong> Project Wine is one of the largest wine 
		processing plants is the state.  They process grapes from all over South Australia 
		for various wineries.  The Eucalyptus plantation has been grown for the sole purpose 
		of utilising the large amounts of water that is used by the processing plant.<br>
Cleland has been working with Project wine for over ten years pruning the trees in the 
plantation and developing some areas into koala feed trees.<br>
Cleland’s volunteers have also carried out two plantings at this location.

	   <p><strong> Seasonal Influences</strong><br>
		No entry when wet.<br>
		We tend not to cut here during harvest as a lot of the wastewater is put out on to 
		the plantation. <br> 
		No entry in extreme heat.</p>

	   
     
	 
	 <p><strong> Safety Issues and Hazards</strong><br>
	 Mosquitoes, be sure to apply insect repellent.
Ant, snakes.  <br>
Please do not let any winery wastewater on to the leaves.

      <p><strong>Cutting techniques</strong><br>
      Cut regrowth flush to the ground.  Narelle will mark other trees that she would like removed.  
If unsure, please liaise with Narelle (very sensitive to the environment and the trees).<br>
2 gum cutting staff</p>


    	  
	   <p><strong>Maintenance Requirements Overview</strong><br>
	  All small off cuts can be left in the rows for the slasher to cut.<br>
All larger wood can be stacked neatly at the end of the rows, left so an loader can easily pick up.
