      <p>In all sections, the pollarded trees are to be repolladed when the branches are big enough, new trees that have grown to approx. 20cm diameter can be pollarded. Please be sure to pollard branches flush to the stump. 1 or 2 gum cutting staff.</p>

      <p><strong>Maintenance Requirements Overview </strong></p>
      <p>Tidying up old pollards, pruning the newer pollarded trees.
Please pile large wood and offcuts in to burn piles on the open grass at the top of the rows.  If too heavy, please try to
 make neat piles running with the tree line so a slasher can still get up and down the rows.</p>

<p>Annual maintenance: 
May through to October - burn off any wood and debris piles
May through to October - weeding
Oct/Nov - Slash whole site
