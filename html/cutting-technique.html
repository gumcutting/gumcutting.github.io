		<h3 style="text-align: center;">Importance of cutting quality gum</h3>

	<p>Providing koalas with a quality, varied species diet is one of the most important aspects of keeping Koala in captivity.<br>
	Our goal at Cleland is to house a collection of Koalas for the purpose of public education, tourism, research and breeding.<br>
	Delivering premium gum to our koalas helps ensure good koala health, well-being and behaviour.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align: center;">Plantation cutting</h3>

	<p>The aim of pollarding our plantation trees is to get the tree to produce and grow leaf rather than wood.<br>
	This involves regular and heavy pruning encourages this younger leaf growth.<br>
	In all the plantations we pollard the trees once they grow to approx. 20 to 25 cm diameter.</p>
<br>

		<h3 style="text-align: center;">Pollarding a tree</h3>
	<p>To make the initial pollard cut use a sharp chainsaw to make a scarf cut in the tree to guard against tearing the bark on the tree.<br>
	   Make the cut at waist height facing North, be sure to have an angle on the cut to ensure good water drainage. (approx.30 to 40 degrees.<br>
</p><br>

		<br><br>

		<h3 style="text-align: center;">Pruning a pollarded tree</h3>
		
		<p>After approx. 12 months (depending on light access and weather conditions) the newly pollarded tree has had a flush of new growth with many new leaders. </p> 
<br><br>

		<br><br>

<p>To encourage the tree to produce productive gum pieces for koala feed we then prune up the new growth to have anything from 7 to
 10 leaders and discard all other growth.  Once pruned is now left for another 12 to 18 months.<p>

			<h3 style="text-align: center;">Ready to harvest</h3>
			
<p>After approx. 12 to 18 month the pollarded tree should be ready to harvest, with 7 to 10 strong branches approximately 10 to 15 centimetres in diameter.</p>

<img src="../images/not-good.jpg" alt="Cut flush back to stump." class="images">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Example of not good pollard.  The bark is ripped, the cut is rough.  This tree will potentially not recover and will dry out or rot out and die.</figcaption>
<br><br>
				
		
	<p>When pollarding a tree, it is important to ensure none of the bark around the circumference of the tree is ripped.  The tree will dry out and struggle.  The cut is left rough and open, water will sit in these crevices and eventually rot out the
	tree causing the tree not to reshoot and die. </p>
	<br><br>
	
	
	<img src="../images/not-good2.jpg" alt="Cut flush back to stump." class="images">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">This tree has been repollarded and not tidied up properly.</figcaption>
<br><br>
	
	
		<p>What will potentially happen here is the tree will put its energy into the side straggly pieces of gum that have been left behind and will not put all its energy into a 
		flush of new growth.<br>
		Please ensure when repollarding trees that every branch and twig is cut flush back to the tree stump.</p>
		<br><br>
		

<img src="../images/tidied.jpg" alt="Same tree tidied up." class="images">

<img src="../images/not-flush.jpg" alt="not flush." class="images">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Three branches have been cut not flush to the stump, these 
cut branches will potentially dry out and die and not reshoot,   there is also a torn branch that 
will dry out and  not reshoot.  The three branches left will continue growing until cut.  This tree 
would have been better to cut all the branches flush back to the stump to encourage a flush of new growth.</figcaption>
<br><br>
		
		<p style= "text-align: center;"><b>When harvesting a pollarded tree be ruthless and take the all the leader branches.</b></p> 
		<br><br>

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">These cuts need to be cut flush back to the stump.</figcaption>
<br><br>
		
		<p>This tree has been pollarded but the cuts need to be much closer to the stump.  If left like this the protruding wood can dry out and not reshoot.  
		It is safer to cut as close back to the stump as possible.</p>
		<br><br>

<p>An example of a tree just lopped off without much after thought. 
 Ultimately it is too small in diameter to pollard.  But now it has been cut, the rest of 
 the branches need to back all cut back to the trunk to encourage new growth.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Quick and careless cutting </figcaption>
<br><br>


<p>The cut protruding wood will potentially die and the one leader that is left will potentially be slow growing.  To fix it would be best 
to recut al cuts back to the stump along with the one leader that was left.</p>

<br><br>


  <h3 style="text-align: center;">Good housekeeping</h3> 
  <br><br>
  
<p>Please do not leave off cuts laying around the plantations.  </p>

<img src="../images/piles.jpg" alt="stack neat piles on the track " class="images">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Please be mindful and stack neat piles on the track edges or 
neatly in open space ready for collection and burn off.</figcaption>
<br><br>

<p>Always stack offcuts into neat piles and place on track edge for readiness to be picked up to burn 
off later.  If too heavy or too far from the track edge, do you best to stack in an open area to be 
burn where is or make piles parallel with the plantation rows to enable slashers to still have row access.  Please ask if unsure.</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>

 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Cutting in Conservation Parks</h3> 
  <br>

<p>Please be mindful when cutting in Conservation parks all cuts need to be low to the ground flush back to 
the stump, inconspicuous cutting unlike the plantation pollard cuts.</p>
<br><br>

 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Cutting on Forestry Land in between Pine plantations</h3> 
  <br>
  
  <p>When cutting and clearing our red gum saplings in amongst the pine plantations on Forestry land, please be 
  sure to cut the saplings flush to the ground to avoid making tripping hazards.</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>

 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Under power lines cutting</h3> 
 <br>
  
  <p>Cleland has a lot of gum cutting areas directly under powerlines.  Some of these areas are 
  somewhat opportunistic and are best to cleared out before the ETSA gum cutters come through and do 
  the annual fire safety cut normally in springtime, which means we lose all the gum if we haven’t 
  kept it low enough under the power lines.  Please keep a close eye on all under powerline areas 
  and ensure that the gum does not get too high.</p>
<br>
 
 
 <img src="../images/powerlines.jpg" alt="under powerlines" class="images">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Always keep gum directly under powerlines low to avoid fire danger.</figcaption>
<br>


<h3 style="text-align: center;">Track edges cutting</h3> 
  <br>

 <p>Track edge cutting is used to keep the tracks clear for fire safety 
 in Conservation parks and Forestry Areas. Please cut trees low to the ground 
 (inconspicuous cutting).
</p>
<br>

 <h3 style="text-align: center;">Habitat for Wildlife</h3> 
 <br>
<p>Please be mindful that the plantation trees are utilised by the local wildlife, sometimes you will have to work around 
them and leave trees that are being used as resting and nesting spots.</p>
<br><br>


<img src="../images/wildlife.jpg" alt="eggs in a tree" class="images">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Please be mindful that the plantation trees are utilised by the local wildlife</figcaption>
<br><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Length and quality of gum pieces</h3> 
 <br>

<p>When cutting the gum into feed pieces it is important to cut them to a manageable size for all staff to handle safely 
and comfortably.  It is inefficient if the pieces are cut too long or too short.<br>
When pieces are cut too long the keepers have trouble putting the gum in and out of the gum holding pots with ease and normally 
these pieces must be recut which is time wasting.<br>
When pieces are cut to short the koalas have trouble getting to the gum. <br>
The height to aim for a good piece of koala feed gum is approx. between 150 to 180 cm in length.<br>
The height to aim for tip is approx. 150 cm in length.
It is vital that only good quality gum is bought back to the park to feed out to the koalas.
<br><br>

small amount of palatable tip at top, would need 4 of these pieces to make up for one feed piece.</figcaption>
<br><br>


<h3 style="text-align: center;">Collecting Tips</h3> 
 <br>

<p>Keeping up a good supply of gum tip for the handling sessions and training 
of the koalas is of the highest importance.  It can make or break a day for the Koala 
Keepers working with the koalas as good quality tip is the catalyst to providing the best 
koala experience for our park guests and a positive experience for out koalas.</p>
<br><br>


<img src="../images/koala1.jpg" alt="Koala" class="images">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Delicious!!</figcaption>
<br><br>


<p>When harvesting gum always be on the lookout for good tip. During the Winter months
 it is challenging to find new growth tip and tend to reply heavily on Platypus and 
 Swamp Yate which the koalas seem to like all year round.<br>
When collecting tip but not wanting to cut the whole trees down, it is possible just 
to snip the tops out of the tree to get the tippy tops.</p>

<br><br>


<h3 style="text-align: center;">Feeding out of Gum to Koalas and feedback </h3> 
 <br>
 
<p>The best indicator of gauging how well the gum is accepted by the koalas is through 
observing the koalas and communicating closely with the Senior Koala Keeper for keeper feedback.</p>
<br><br>

<img src="../images/koalastaff.jpg" alt="Good communication with the Koala staff is so valuable 
to know how the gum is being received by the koalas." class="images">
<figcaption style="text-align: center;">Good communication with the Koala staff is so valuable 
to know how the gum is being received by the koalas.</figcaption>
<br><br>

<p>When the koalas are given their fresh gum, a great indicator is if they appear animated,
 interested, and start eating straight away.  However, koalas being koalas do sleep a lot so
 checking again in the morning after they have browsed through the evening and assess how popular 
 the gum has been best.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Guide to gum feeding amounts</h3> 
 <br>
 Cleland works on feeding two pieces of gum daily to each koala, preferably of varied species.<br>
Presently we keep 85 koalas<br>
85 x 2 pieces = 164 pieces a day <br>
Rounded up to 170 a day<br>
170 x 7 days = 1190 per week<br>
Rounded up to 1200 pieces per week.<br>
These totals will fluctuate as the numbers of koalas kept at the park vary.<br>
You will always be guided by the Senior Koala keeper to the koala population numbers.<br>
Gum tip numbers are in addition.<br>
Tip is approx. 20 pieces a day of varied species depending on the season.<br>
Weekly total approx. 140 tip pieces.<br>


<h3 style="text-align: center;">Collecting gum for unwell Koalas</h3> 
 <br>
 
 <p>When koalas become unwell, they become even more fussy.  
 The keepers may ask for gum from a particular area or tree as they know it will 
 help the individual koala that is in care.  As tedious as this sometimes is, it is 
 worth it to get the unwell koalas back to health.<br>
Please work closely with the keepers when these situations occur.</p>
