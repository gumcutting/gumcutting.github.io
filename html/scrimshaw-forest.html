	   <p><strong> Seasonal Influences</strong><br>
		Being a SA Blue gum plantation, cutting is best on cooler days and seasons. <br>
Ground is sandy, but if a wet season, please do not enter until ground has dried out.

	   
	   
	   
     
	 
	 <p><strong> Safety Issues and Hazards</strong><br>
	Snakes, ants, tripping hazards

      <p><strong>Cutting techniques</strong><br>
      The Scrimshaw plantation is a new area that we are trail cutting for the next 6 months
	  from January 2022 to assist thinning out a PIRSA (Department of Primary Industries 
	  and Regions of South Australia.<br>
Using the above plot map, we can initially start in the blue squares on the eastern side.
  Taking out any gums that are struggling and pollarding or taking back to ground level the 
  larger gums.  A trial of both forms of cutting will be carried out.





    	  
	   <p><strong>Maintenance Requirements Overview</strong><br>
	 Larger tree trunks can be cut into large pieces that can be piled 
	 up in the centre of every second row.  Straggly offcuts can also be piled 
	 up in every second row separately to the heavier firewood.
