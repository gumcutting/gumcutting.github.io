        <li><strong>Plantation History</strong> Forestry SA has kindly allowed us to 
		utilise this large area of trees for koala feed.  Originally the trees of varying 
		species were planted for research.  The research is now over, giving Cleland this 
		wonderful opportunity to now develop the area in koala leaf plantations.<br>
Cleland has been cutting here the last 3 years.  Early in the piece TAFE dropped many 
trees for training, however these trees were not cleaned up well, also some TAFE cuts are 
left which are not ideal.<br>
TAFE does not cut here anymore.

	 <p><strong> Safety Issues and Hazards</strong><br>
	Tripping hazards, working on slopes, carrying gum long distances, hopper ants, snakes etc.<br>
Take care on windy days when dropping the larger straighter trees.

      <p><strong>Cutting techniques</strong><br>
     Over the last 3 years, Cleland gum cutters have been working pollarding the labelled 
	 areas to develop into workable koala feedlot plantations.<br>
At this stage, please leave the large trees as whole until we follow up with how we are 
cleaning the area up.

Red 1: Continue to pollard larger trees to let more light into this area.<br>

Blue 1: Continue to pollard larger trees.<br>

Mixed 1: Pollard koala species in this area, ensuring that the stump has light. <br>

Red 2: Continue to pollard these larger woody trees (a lot of work now, but should be worth 
it for the regrowth)<br>

Blue Gum 2: Continue to pollard larger trees.  Baring in mind if the trees are too close 
together, pollard the stronger trees and cut the weaker trees off ant ground level to help 
open up this area.<br>

Mixed 2 and 3: Continue to pollard the larger trees and cutting the smaller weaker trees
 off at ground level. <br>

Stringybark 1: Continue to pollard the larger trees<br>

Manna Gum 1: Pollard large trees, ensuing that the pollarded stumps get light.<br>

	   <p><strong>Maintenance Requirements Overview</strong><br>
	All large wood needs to be removed.  Larger machinery will be needed.
Please see annual maintenance plan.<br>

Red 1:   Prune pollarded trees <br>

Blue 1:  Prune pollarded trees when ready<br>

Mixed 2 and 3: Prune pollarded trees when ready<br>

A lot of smaller straggly trees can be removed at ground level to open up area for the 
larger trees and pollarded trees.<br>

Blue 2: Prune pollarded trees when ready<br>

Stringybark 1: Please cut all long Stringybark trunks in to 5 metre lengths in 
readiness for koala perching.  <br><br>

Please mark these lengths with flagging tape and if possible, stack on the track edge 
for ease to find on pick up day.<br>

Manna gum 1: leave larger trees complete until we hear if we can get larger machinery 
in to assist with the clean-up.<br>
