        <li><strong>Plantation History</strong>An area within the Conservation that was 
		originally planted by the zoo over 40 years ago.  It has mixed indigenous and 
		nonindigenous gum species.<br>
Unfortunately, Nursery Loop has had very little management and is in desperate need of some 
resources.<br>
Some of the nonindigenous species are spilling in the Conservation park.

	   <p><strong>Maintenance Requirements Overview</strong></p>
	   <p>Nursery loop needs the area to be redone, burnout, large fur bushes removed.<br>
		Long term this area could be a project to apply for funding to improve the area, it 
		is in a Conservation Park with non-indigenous species spilling into the park as well 
		as being full of weeds.<br>
		With a remodel, this area can be a productive close koala feed plantation.
