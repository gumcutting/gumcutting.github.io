<p>Between the months of April through to November a Gum Plantation Volunteer group runs one morning a 
week.<br>
“Many hands help make like work.”<br>
Working closely with Bess Hillyard, Cleland’s Volunteer Coordinator a group of keen volunteers are
 coordinated to meet one morning a week to assist with weed control, tidying up of debris, pruning,
 whipper snipping, planting etc.<br>
It generally runs from 9.00am to 1 pm with a morning tea break.<br>
This is a great opportunity to organise small achievable projects in plantations close to Cleland, 
e.g. Long Ridge.<br>
Projects to work on with the Gum Plantation Volunteers:<br>
Weeding Long Ridge (refer to weed guide for weed ID)<br>
Piling up wood and branches ready for burning off in early spring.<br>
Pruning up pollarded trees to enhance leaf growth<br>
Infill planting in the plantations</p>

	<p>Each year if in the position to plant new trees Bess can assist in organising 
	volunteers for planting days. </p>
